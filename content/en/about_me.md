## About me {#about-me}

I'm Ramsay, a software engineer making a living by pressing keyboard, an amateur cook, an Emacs deadhead and Linux enthusiast.

The slogan of this site is ****In pursuit of Simplicity****, because I prefer simple over complex

## Projects {#projects}

I've contributed multiple projects to open source community, I mainly focus on RSpotify right now due to the constrained energy.

-   [RSpotify](<https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify>): A Spotify Web API wrapper implemented in Rust.
