## <span class="section-num">1</span> Goodbye 2023 {#goodbye-2023}

As I farewelled to 2023, a year marked by numerous changes and personal evolution, I find myself recollecting the multitude of experiences that unfolded. <br/>

My 2023 journey was nothing short of fascinating and exciting, prompting me to revisit the year from various angles. <br/>

After seeing hoards of posts in social media generated by [Github Contributions Chart](https://github.com/sallar/github-contributions-chart), I thought I could also build an APP to summarize my Github contribution for every year for friends to have fun. <br/>

I spent my entire 4-days-new-year vocation to build this app named: [Github Summary](https://github-summary.vercel.app/). <br/>

This project led me through a series of first-time experiences: first time to try Tailwind Css framework, first time to use and deploy project on Vercel, first time to build project on nextjs, first time to develop a public project on React(yes, I've tried to learn React for hundreds of times, but never get a chance to use it in real project), etc. <br/>


## <span class="section-num">2</span> Happy 2024 {#happy-2024}

While I hoped I could have completed this project by the close of 2023 to share summaries with friends, life's timeline had other plans. <br/>

Now, as we step into 2024, I am thrilled to publish the GitHub Summary. <br/>

It's never too late to showcase creative work, and this project is poised to generate insightful summaries not just for the past year but for the adventures that await in 2024. <br/>

Wishing everyone a Happy New Year! Feel free to explore [GitHub Summary](https://github-summary.vercel.app/): <https://github-summary.vercel.app/> <br/>
