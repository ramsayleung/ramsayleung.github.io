## About me {#about-me}

I'm Ramsay, I chase a lot of different things. My slogan is ****to be a lazy programmer****, since:

> There are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris -- [Larry Wall](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall>)

The first programming language I learned is \`Pascal\` in a computer-hobbyist group when I was a middle school student. Back to time before, the only thing I could do with \`Pascal\` was trying to find the maximum or minimum number among the number array, or just calculate the sum of them, which is of less fun. I didn't really start programming before I became a fresh student majared in software enginering in my university. I've build a lot of different stuffs for personal use or simply out of curiosity, you could find them at my [Github project](<https://github.com/ramsayleung>).

Nowaday, I am employed by Ant Financial(Alibaba group), aka Alipay, make a living by doing some Java stuff, working overtime every working day(whick also known as [996 work schedule](<https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU>)). I am also interested in Rust/Python/C++, but find no way to build some industrial level softwares with these languages.

Update:
I have left Ant Financial,  now I am working for Wechat Pay, just embracing the change, as what my ex-employer encourages to do.

## Book {#book}

I love to reading books, the reading of all good books is like a comfortable conversation with the most brilliant people of the past centuries, it also brings me unknown friends. As for book, my taste is history, politics, novel and computer science. Right, I get used to write summary of them after reading(mostly in Chinese). Reading does feed me.
