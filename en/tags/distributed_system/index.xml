      <description>1 Preface I have been maintained a legacy distributed timer for months for my employer, then some important pay business are leveraging on it, with 1 billion tasks handled every day and 20k tasks added per second at most.
Even though it&amp;rsquo;s old and full of black magic code, but it also also have insighted and well-designed code. Based on this old, running timer, I summarize and extract as this article, and it wont include any running code(perhaps pseudocode, and a lot of figures, as an adage says: A picture is worth a thousand words).</description>
