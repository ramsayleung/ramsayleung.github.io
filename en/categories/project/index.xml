<p>As I farewelled to 2023, a year marked by numerous changes and personal evolution, I find myself recollecting the multitude of experiences that unfolded. <br/></p>
<p>My 2023 journey was nothing short of fascinating and exciting, prompting me to revisit the year from various angles. <br/></p>
<p>After seeing hoards of posts in social media generated by <a href="https://github.com/sallar/github-contributions-chart">Github Contributions Chart</a>, I thought I could also build an APP to summarize my Github contribution for every year for friends to have fun. <br/></p>
<p>I spent my entire 4-days-new-year vocation to build this app named: <a href="https://github-summary.vercel.app/">Github Summary</a>. <br/></p>
<p>This project led me through a series of first-time experiences: first time to try Tailwind Css framework, first time to use and deploy project on Vercel, first time to build project on nextjs, first time to develop a public project on React(yes, I&rsquo;ve tried to learn React for hundreds of times, but never get a chance to use it in real project), etc. <br/></p>
<h2 id="happy-2024"><span class="section-num">2</span> Happy 2024</h2>
<p>While I hoped I could have completed this project by the close of 2023 to share summaries with friends, life&rsquo;s timeline had other plans. <br/></p>
<p>Now, as we step into 2024, I am thrilled to publish the GitHub Summary. <br/></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never too late to showcase creative work, and this project is poised to generate insightful summaries not just for the past year but for the adventures that await in 2024. <br/></p>
<p>Wishing everyone a Happy New Year! Feel free to explore <a href="https://github-summary.vercel.app/">GitHub Summary</a>: <a href="https://github-summary.vercel.app/">https://github-summary.vercel.app/</a> <br/></p>
