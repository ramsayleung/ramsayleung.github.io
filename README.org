* Description
  The blog is migrated from the original self-hosted [[https://github.com/ramsayleung/blog][blog]] which was interesting and delightful to build something from scratch.

  There is Ramsay's personal blog, where he shares a bit of what he has learned along the way.

* Cloning and Setup
  Even though this blog is tailored to serve my own purpose, but this blog is designed to be easily cloned and adapted for your own use as well. Here are the steps to get started:

** 1. Clone the Repository**
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/ramsayleung/ramsayleung.github.io.git
   cd ramsayleung.github.io
   #+end_src

** 2. Update Configuration**
   The main configuration file is `config.yml`. You'll need to update it with your personal information.

*** Social Media
    Update the information to your own social media accordingly.
      #+begin_src yaml
      params:
        socialIcons:
            - name: github
            url: "[YOUR_GITHUB_URL]"
            - name: stackoverflow
            url: "[YOUR_STACKOVERFLOW_URL]"
            - name: x
            url: "[YOUR_TWITTER_URL]"
            - name: linkedin
            url: "[YOUR LINKEDIN URL]"
            - name: telegram
            url: "[YOUR TELEGRAM URL]"
      #+end_src
*** Giscus Comments
    This blog uses [[https://giscus.app/][giscus]] for comments, which is based on GitHub Discussions. To set it up for your own repository, you need to update the following section in `config.yml`:

    #+begin_src yaml
    params:
      giscus:
        repo: "[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME]"
        repoId: "[YOUR_REPO_ID]"
        category: "[YOUR_DISCUSSION_CATEGORY_NAME]"
        categoryId: "[YOUR_CATEGORY_ID]"

      socialIcons:
          - name: github
          url: "[YOUR_GITHUB_URL]"
          - name: stackoverflow
          url: "[YOUR_STACKOVERFLOW_URL]"
          - name: x
          url: "[YOUR_TWITTER_URL]"
          - name: linkedin
          url: "[YOUR LINKEDIN URL]"
          - name: telegram
          url: "[YOUR TELEGRAM URL]"
    #+end_src

    You can get the `repoId` and `categoryId` by following the instructions on the giscus website.
